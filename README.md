# Clicky_Game
I created a memory game with React. This application's UI is broken into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
<br>
The application renders different images to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.
<br>
The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if he/she clicks the same image more than once.
<br>
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
